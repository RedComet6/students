## Description

This is an example of a social network API. When a user uses a command to invoke the application, the database is connected to through mongoose, the models are synced, and then the express server is connected. When a user calls GET routes for "users" and "thoughts", the response is displayed in JSON. When a user calls POST, PUT, and DELETE routes, the user is able to create, update, and delete "users" and "thoughts" from the database. The user also has access to routes allowing the adding and subtracting of friends to a user, the adding and subtracting of thoughts to a user, and the adding and subtracting of reactions to a thought.
